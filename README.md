Supermarket sales visualization 

QUESTION ONE: The following are the steps taken in transforming my 
data
STEP ONE: I converted the data column data type from text to data and then cleaning it by filtering out the 
error. I did the cleaning by going to home tab, click on remove error rows, then click on remove error, by this 
way I was able to clean and remove the error rows. The error was because some of the months was not correct.
STEP TWO: I created more columns by using date column. During the process, I created a new column for the 
year, the months, and the day.
STEP THREE: for consistency, I started all the column names with capital letter, i.e by changing the one with 
lowercase and leaving the uppercase to be they was.
STEP FOUR: I converted the data category of the city column to “City”.
STEP FIVE: And finally I created a revenue column by multiplying quantity by price.


QUESTION TWO(F): What hours are the sales peak hour
i.
11:25:00 and the revenue generated at that hour is $1,757.00K
ii.
16:20:00 and the revenue generated at that hour is $990.00K
QUESTION TWO(G) What is the relationship between the gross income of a customer and the type of 
payment used?
The relationship between a customer’s gross income and preferred type of payment can vary. Generally, 
customers with higher incomes might be more inclined to use credit card for conveniences, rewards, and 
flexibility. On the other hand, individuals with lower incomes may prefer cash or debit cards to manage their 
spending more easily. It’s a complex interplay influenced by personal financial habits, lifestyle and preferences.


QUESTION 3(I) INSIGHTS
1. The data set shows that total amount for the profit is $107.00K, total units sold is 2345 and total revenue 
generated is $129.00K.
2. Three cities in Myanmarr was considered in this data and the cities are Naypyitaw, Mandalay and 
Yangun. Out of these cities,Naypyitaw lead the way with revenue of $45.00K, then Mandalay and 
finally Yangun. Although, lots of products were sold in those cities and the top products are in the 
products line of Helath and beauty, home and lifestyle and sports and travels. The workers also 
contributed a lot by creating good communication with customers which made it so comfortable for the 
customers.
3. One of the products is Home and lifestyle which has the highest revenue generated at the rate of 
$25,362.00K and followed by food and beverages. The peak hour is 11:25:00 and revenue generated is
$1,757.00K.
4. In conclusion, the peak hour should be monitored and more staff should be provided. 

QUESTION 3(II) RECOMMENDATION
The sales should be focused on Mandalay and Yangun that has lower sales compared to other Cities. And the 
hours with least sale should be noted out know the reason and so improvement can be made.
Since there is more revenue in Naypyitaw, the supply of products should be taken serious so as to make sure 
that products are always available, especially the top three in the products line.
With what I highlighted above, I recommend exploring potential synergies among all the products lines to 
optimize cross-selling opportunities and enhance overall revenue generation. Understanding the unique value 
The preposition of each product will enable tailor strategic approaches for maximizing profitability.
For the manager to facilitate this analysis, I advise the manager to consider market research and also engaging 
cross-functional teams, including sales, marketing and products development.
QUESTION 3(III). PATTERNS AND TRENDS OBSERVED
Linear Trends lines: That is the lines that connect the prices points. The lines indicate a rising trend which is an 
increase in the price and also decreasing lines which indicate a downward trend.
The inside bar pattern: The bar’s high price is lower than the previous bar’s price. And also the lower price is 
higher than the low price of the previous bar. This shows the market is consolidating and may not have strong 
trends either in direction.


QUESTION 4: REFLECTION
Data cleaning and transformation: this is more of filtering out dirt from data, giving it a better look and a more 
convenient way to visualize the data. Data transformation is very necessary because the beauty of your 
visualization depends on the cleaning and measures created. Through the course I was able to find my around 
power query, how to make use of features and the process help me a lot in the cleaning. Transforming my data 
into actionable information were also possible.
Also understand the importance of selecting appropriate chart types, utilizing the features like color themes, chat clarity and good impact of data representation.
